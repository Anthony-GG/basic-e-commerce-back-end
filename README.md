## Description
    
### The goal of this project was to create a basic E-Commerce Backend that allows for basic GET, POST, DEL, and PUT requests to interface with a connected Database, hosted via ExpressJS!
### Behind the scenes, this program heavily relies on MySQL again, but instead, is working synchronously with different software to better control and distribute data to an end user/program.
